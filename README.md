# Scalable AI PDF Summary Generator

A scalable microservices-based application for generating AI-powered PDF summaries, supporting multiple user roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer). The system leverages asynchronous processing for PDF analysis and provides a robust API layer for user and document management.

## üöÄ What Does This Application Do?

- **AI PDF Summary Generation:** Upload PDFs and receive AI-generated summaries.
- **User Roles:**
  - **Admin:** Manage users, documents, and system settings.
  - **Editor:** Upload and manage documents.
  - **Viewer:** View summaries and documents.
- **Microservices Architecture:**
  - **NestJS Backend:** Exposes REST APIs, handles authentication, user management, and document ingestion.
  - **Python Event Consumer:** Asynchronously processes and analyzes PDFs, generating summaries using AI.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** PDF analysis is offloaded to the Python service via RabbitMQ for scalability and responsiveness.

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start Guide

### 1. Clone the Project and Submodules

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Saurav15/pdf-analyzer-microservice.git
cd pdf-analyzer-microservice
```

### 2. Environment Variable Setup

All environment variables needed for configuring various infrastructure services like Postgres, RabbitMQ, and pgAdmin are located in the root `.env` file.

- Copy the example file to create your own `.env`:
  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```
- Update the values in `.env` as needed for your setup.

**Note:** You will also need to set up environment variables for the backend and python-event-consumer services in their respective directories, according to the requirements of each service. Refer to the README files in `backend/` and `python-event-consumer/` for details on what variables are needed and example files if provided.

### 3. Python Event Consumer Environment Setup

- Go to the Python event consumer directory:
  ```bash
  cd ../python-event-consumer
  ```
- Add the required environment variables in a `.env` file. Reference can be taken from `.env.example` in the same directory.

### 4. Run the Complete Project (All Services)

- Return to the project root and start all services using Docker Compose:

  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --profile full up --build
  ```

- For production, use the main Docker Compose file:

  ```bash
  docker compose up --build
  ```

- **Note:** Database migrations and seeders are run automatically during startup.

### 5. Accessing the Services

- **API Documentation (Swagger):** [http://localhost:3000/api/docs](http://localhost:3000/api/docs)
- **RabbitMQ UI:** [http://localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672) (ID: `guest`, PW: `guest`)
- **pgAdmin:** [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) (Email: `admin@admin.com`, PW: `admin123`)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note for Development (Backend Service)

When running the backend service in development mode with Docker Compose, the local `./backend` directory is mounted into the container as a volume. This means your local files (including the absence of `node_modules` if you haven't run `npm install`) will overwrite the container's `/app` directory. As a result, the dependencies installed during the Docker build (including `cross-env` and others) will not be available inside the container unless you have also installed them locally.

**To avoid errors like `sh: cross-env: not found`, you must run the following command on your host machine before starting the containers:**

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

This ensures that all required Node.js dependencies are present in your local `backend/node_modules` directory, which will then be available inside the container during development.

## üõë Stopping the Services

- To stop and remove containers:
  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
  ```
- To stop and remove containers **and** volumes:
  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down --volumes
  ```

---

## üß© Docker Compose Profiles

- **full**: Runs all services (backend, python consumer, postgres, rabbitmq, pgAdmin). Use for full development and integration testing.
- **infra**: Runs only infrastructure services (postgres, rabbitmq, pgAdmin). Use when developing a single microservice locally and only need the supporting infrastructure.
- **backend**: Runs backend service and infrastructure. Use when working only on the backend.
- **python**: Runs python event consumer and infrastructure. Use when working only on the Python service.

Start a specific profile by replacing `full` in the up command, e.g.:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --profile backend up --build
```

## Microservice Development

Each microservice can be developed and tested independently. Refer to the individual README files in each service directory for specific development instructions:

- [Backend Service Documentation](./backend/README.md)
- [Python Event Consumer Documentation](./python-event-consumer/README.md)
